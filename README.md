# simple-speech-recognition
Why make it complicated if it can be simple?
This small library abstracts away all those nitty-gritty details you have to pay attention to when using the
browser-integrated `SpeechRecognition`, and lets you focus on what's important: **your own code**.

## Installation
Install this package using `npm` or `yarn`:
